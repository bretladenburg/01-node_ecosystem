#Introduction to the Node Ecosystem

##This project is an introduction to the concepts of writing simple response code for the back end, and writing tests to determine if they work as intended or not.  The greet.js file is a simple function that returns a greeting from whatever name parameter that is put into the function, and it requires the use of a string as well as some input.  The arithmetic.js file is an object that we created two methods for, an "add" and a "sub" method.  These are for adding and subtracting values that are put into their parameters.  The greet-test.js file is a file that tests to see if our greeting function is working as intended and our arithmetic-test.js is another test that ensures that the arithmetic functions that we have wrote behave properly.
